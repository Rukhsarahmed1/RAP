**RAP - package

This file gives a short description to the RAP-package.
The cost of health has significantly increased in the past 10 years, due to the rising costs of
healthcare service. There are many factors that contribute to determining healthcare costs,
including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking and region. Let’s
examine how these factors impact the healthcare costs for a sample of the population.
The dataset consists of 7 columns, 6 of which are features and 1 is the target column (Charges).
Features in dataset:
1. age: Age of the Primary beneficiary.
2. sex: Insurance contractor’s gender.
3. bmi: Insurance contractor’s bmi(body mass index).
4. children: The number of the children(dependents) covered by health insurance.
5. smoker: Is the insurance contractor’s smoking or not.
6. region: Region shows residential area in United States (US).
7. charges: The total charges for medical expenses incurred, as billed by the health insurance.
These features can be used to predict healthcare costs and understand the factors that contribute to
them.
